CIS395 Assignment 2

Screen 1: Login page with Username and Password. Assume that a button click to login is always successful and leads to the second screen.

Screen 2: List of Notes. 10 note names that link to the third page (all the same link). When the screen is made small enough that the whole list cannot fit onto the page, the list overflow should be scrollable
There should be a button to add a new note (this can also just lead to the third screen).

Screen 3: Note Editor. Large, editable title at the top of the page. It will have 2 buttons, SAVE and DELETE. When these buttons are clicked, a pop up message will show the used that this was successful (even though they do not call back to the server yet).
The bulk of the screen will be a large, editable text area.

Logging: Whenever one of these routes is called, it should log that the request was received and server the page.
